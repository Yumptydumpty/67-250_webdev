                <h2>Welcome to Pamela's Diner</h2>
                <h4>
                    &emsp; Pamela's Diner is a prominent chain of diners in Pittsburgh, 
                    Pennsylvania, USA. Its specialties are crepe-style pancakes, 
                    omelets and Lyonnaise potatoes. It is "treasured" and is 
                    considered to be in the "pantheon of pancake purveyors". 
                    In 2013, Pamela's Diner was featured by the Wall Street 
                    Journal in a "What to Do in Pittsburgh" feature story. 
                    Pamela's Diner is owned by Gail Klingensmith and Pam Cohen. 
                    Both educated as teachers, the business partners handle different 
                    tasks, Klingensmith with the more business end and Cohen as "the 
                    culinary artist". The first Pamela's Diner location, in the Squirrel 
                    Hill neighborhood, opened in 1979. Subsequent locations have opened in 
                    Shadyside, the Strip District, Millvale, Oakland and Mt. Lebanon.

                <h4>
                    &emsp; During the 2008 United States presidential election, 
                    Barack Obama visited Pamela's Diner for a campaign visit. Once 
                    elected, President Obama invited Klingensmith and Cohen to the 
                    White House for a Memorial Day breakfast with the Obama family 
                    and 80 veterans. Later that year, during the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh 
                    summit, President Obama expressed dismay that he was unable 
                    to return to Pamela's Diner during that trip, but First Lady 
                    Michelle Obama did visit. Incidentally, the Oakland storefront 
                    received damage during the protests that accompanied the G-20 
                    summit.

                <h4>
                    &emsp; Pamela's Diner announced in December 2021 that their original 
                    Squirrel Hill location will be closing largely due to COVID-19. 
                    With the loss of several long-time employees, the location decided 
                    to shut its doors. As the first Pamela's Diner location, it has 
                    been around 42 years. The other diner locations will stay open, 
                    however. The owners hinted that they are open to another, smaller 
                    Squirrel Hill location in the future.
