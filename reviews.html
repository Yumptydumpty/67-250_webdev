                                <p class="review_text">We stopped here for brunch on a road trip to see family. So glad we did - food was delicious! We arrived around 10AM on a weekday and had a 10-15 minute wait. We did notice there were a few open tables, but we also noticed that the wait staff, though busy, did not appear stressed or overworked. I'd rather wait a bit than have them cramming as many people in as possible and overworking their staff! We also appreciated the use of mobile credit card machines. Highly recommend.</p>

                                <p class="review_text">We stopped at Pamela's in the Strip District for brunch before heading home after a weekend. I had the French Toast (very good), and a side of the Pittsburgh Hash (delicious). My family had pancakes, chorizo hash, and eggs. All of it was wonderful and filling. The servers were very bubbly and super friendly</p>

Place gets pretty busy on the weekend and took a minute for the food to come out but we had a large party and it was worth the wait.</p>

Tried the Croissant French Toast, just tastes like good french toast with topping(nothing special). Everything tasted good the next day as well. They were slammed but still very quick service, they were rushing to get our order in but it was nice! Could work on being better with refills, never saw the waitress once we got our food and I didn't get offered a refill until after I finished eating(was water); they were extremely busy though so understandable. Overall, highly recommended.</p>
